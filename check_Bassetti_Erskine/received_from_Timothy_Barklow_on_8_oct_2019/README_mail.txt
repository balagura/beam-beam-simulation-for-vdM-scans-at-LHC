Hi Vladik,

Here is a tarball containing  my B*B code, the Bassett-Erskine C++ code,  
and a diff of my B*B wrt the version of your code that I cloned  in July.
I have also included my current version of comparison.R to show you how I incorporated 
the Bassetti-Erskine formula in comparison.R .

Regards,

Tim
